# Introduction

Wild Swim Scotland is a site for the staff members of Wild Swim Scotland to let their community know about the upcoming wild swims that are happening around Scotland, and for users to sign up for a swim, view their upcoming swims and connect with each other through reviews. 

The site is aimed at the wild swimming community of Scotland and hopes to help build a sense of community for these lovers of the cold!

# Key Project Goals

The goals of the sites functionality are:

- List View: users can see all the swim cards, even if they have not registered or logged in
- Register: users can register to the site so that they can use the sites functionality 
- Logged In: users have the ability to join a swim and view their upcoming joined swims
- Logged Out: users are asked if they wish to sign out of the site
- Staff login: staff users can add new swims, read edit and delete the swims they have created from their staff account
- Reviews: users can write a review on the swim location to let other users know what their experience was, users can read, edit and delete the reviews they personally write from their account

# Agile Development

A Kaban board was used in GitHub to create the agile development process â€“ see the board [here]( https://github.com/users/sarahgoodwin93/projects/3 "Kaban board for Wild Swim Scotland Project")

User stories were labelled using the MoSCoW method.
