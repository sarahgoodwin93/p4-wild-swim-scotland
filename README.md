# Introduction

Wild Swim Scotland is a site for the community of wild swimmers within Scotland to connect and find out about upcoming swims they may wish to participate in. The staff users will post upcoming swims so that their community can join a swim, and site users can go back to the site to view their upcoming swims.

The site is aimed at all wild swimmers around Scotland and hopes to help build a sense of community for these lovers of the cold!

# Key Project Goals

The goals of the sites functionality are:

- List View: users can see all the swim cards, even if they have not registered or logged in
- Register: users can register to the site so that they can use the sites functionality 
- Logged In: users have the ability to join a swim and view their upcoming joined swims
- Logged Out: users are asked if they wish to sign out of the site
- Staff login: staff users can create a new swims, read, edit and delete the swims they have created from their staff account
- Admin: can create new staff users

# Agile Development

A Kaban board was used in GitHub to create the agile development process – see the board [here]( https://github.com/users/sarahgoodwin93/projects/3 "Kaban board for Wild Swim Scotland Project")

User stories were labelled using the MoSCoW method.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

![Wireframe Image](documentation/readme-images/wireframe.png "wireframe image")

Site structure was created before the site was created to test layout idea.
After testing UX, a different approach was taken for better flow of the site navigation. 
Nav bar was moved to middle of page with clear call to actions.
Main image was removed to create focus on swim card images rather than a header image.
Logo was moved to middle of page to have more impact. 

## Database Schema

For this project the Django User Model was used for user account and one custom models with full CRUD were created for creating swims, this model is available for staff users only. 
A second custom model was created for joining a swim, however this does not have full CRUD as users can only edit and delete their joined swim, rather than create and update.

The data schema was created using [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/ "drawsql website homepage") before the project was started to get the flow and function of the models. 

Some of the fields in the below image do not reflect the final data types used (such as Cloudinary) – please see the app for the true data types. 

![Data Schema Image](documentation/readme-images/new-data-schema.png " Data Schema Image ")

## Typography

The google font [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald/ "Oswald font") was used throughout the site with different weights for different headings and paragraphs.

I chose this font for its tall height and wide proportions, making it a great choice for readability and also mimicking the swim cards height, making the site flow nicely. Oswald has rounded corners which give it a friendly appearance while still remaining bold and strong.  

## Colour Palette

I chose the colour #0d1a32 as the primary colour to remind people of the water and paired this with a white background for contrast and for a clean look and finish. As the swims will all have an image of a wild swim, either uploaded by the creator or using the default image, the blues in images from the water will help tie in with #0d1a32 as the primary colour. 

Secondary colours #327ab7 and #d6e4f0 were chosen as a continuation of #0d1a32 with an accent colour of #b5e2e0. These blues all represent the water that draws all swimmers to it. 

![Color palette Image](documentation/readme-images/colour-palette.png "Color palette Image ")

### Logo

The wild swim logo was created by Sarah Goodwin using Photoshop and the Oswald font. Waves were added to tie the site user back to the main purpose of the site, wild swimming.

![Logo Image](documentation/readme-images/ws-logo.png " Logo Image ")

## Design Choices

I wanted the design of the site to feel fresh and clean, just like how a wild swim makes you feel. I wanted the user experience to be easy to navigate and for the site to be very functional – users can come in, see the details they need, choose which swims to join and interact with each other. I did not want unnecessary detail about the swims as part of the fun of wild swimming is going into nature and letting that be your experience rather than overloading with information.

This is why I chose to display the swims as swim cards which have a very clean look.  

![Swim Card](documentation/readme-images/swimcard.png " Swim Card Image ")

# Features

## Existing Features

## Non-Logged in User

### The Landing page And General Site Content

![Homepage](documentation/readme-images/homepage.png " Home page image ")

The landing page of the site shows a non logged in / non registered user the swims cards and gives and explanation of what Wild Swim Scotland is about. 
The text 
*Please see our upcoming swims, with times, dates and difficulty level.
Register an account with us and save your swims so that you can come back to see the details.
There is no limit on the number of swims you can join, or how many people can join them.
We'd love to see you there!*
Gives users a clear indication on what the site offers them and what actions they should next perform.

The landing page has 2 call to actions, Register and Login. 

The landing page is responsive for different screen sizes and scales down for easy mobile or tablet use. 

### Login

![login](documentation/readme-images/login.png " login image ")

The login page welcomes the user back to the site and has 2 clear options, username and password.
The design is friendly and approachable by using rounded corners on the input boxes.

The text at the bottom of the login section lets users know they must be logged into the site to use the full functions, it offers them an action if they have not yet registered by using the sign up link.

If the username and password are not correct this error will show.

![username error](documentation/readme-images/username-error.png " username error image ")

### Register

![register](documentation/readme-images/register-form.png " register form image ")

The register page welcomes users to the site with a friendly greeting. It lets users know that in order to use the site functions they must register an account.

It offers them space for a username, password and then rechecks the password to ensure it matches and there were no errors.
An example of some of the errors:

![register form errors](documentation/readme-images/register-form-errors.png " register form errors image ")

The text at the bottom lets users know who already have an account that they can sign in using the login page.

## Logged in User

### Swim Cards

![joined swims button](documentation/readme-images/join-swim-button.png "joined-swim-button image ")

The first thing the user will notice when the have logged in is that there is now a Join Swim button on the swim cards. This allows users to 'save' swims they are interested in and these swims will appear in their upcoming swims page.

When clicking join swim the user is redirected to the Upcoming Swims page.

I would have liked to change the Join Swim button to say Swim Joined however due to time time constraint this was not possible.

### Your Upcoming Swims

![joined swims](documentation/readme-images/joined-swim-page.png " joined-swim-page image ")

The 'Your Upcoming Swims' page lets users know what swims they have joined previously and allows them to remove swims from their swim list. 

If the user has not yet joined an upcoming swim they will see the message "No swims joined yet"

![no swims joined](documentation/readme-images/no-swims-yet.png " no-swims-joined image ")

The page is solely for the user themselves and does not link to the staff user section of the site. As stated on the homepage, there is no limit to the number of people who can join a swim so therefore staff do not need to know who exactly will be attending. This section of the site is so that users can come back and quickly see what swims they were interested in and check the details easily. 

### Logout

![logout](documentation/readme-images/logout.png " logout image ")

The logout page checks if the user does wish to sign out of the site.

## Staff User

### Add Swim

![add swim form](documentation/readme-images/add-swim-form.png " add swim form image ")

The add swim page allows staff users to add new swims to the swim list. If they have not provided an image for their swim, the placeholder image will be added for them.
The Add Swim page has warnings for both the date, time and swim difficulty fields if they are not entered correctly.
To prevent users from enterting the date in the wrong format the placeholder text 'YYYY-MM-DD' has been added.
To prevent users from enterting the time in the wrong format the placeholder text '00:00:00' has been added.
to prevent users from enterting the swim difficulty incorrectly the 'Between 1-5 text' has been added.
If the above fields are not entered correctly a warning will show.

![add swim warnings](documentation/readme-images/add-swim-warnings.png " add swim warnings image ")


## Edit and Delete buttons

![edit and delete buttons](documentation/readme-images/edit-and-delete-button.png " edit and delete button image ")

The edit and delete buttons only appear to a swim that the specific staff user has added, they cannot edit or delete swims other staff members have created.

When clicking on the edit swim button the form has the same functions as the add swim form, however the swim details are already populated so that the staff user can edit them according. The same error warning functions as the add swim form.

## Delete Swim

When clicking the delete swim button the user is asked if they are sure they want to delete the swim before the action is performed. 

![delete warning](documentation/readme-images/delete-swim.png " delete swim image ")

## Future Features

There are some future features that I would like to add to the project to improve user functions.

- Reviews:
I began to create the review feature of the site, where users could come in and add reviews for different swim locations so that others could make a more informed decision on if they wanted to join a particular swim. However this feature was moved to future implementation as it could not be fully realised to the standard of the project at this time.

- Community Board:
It would be good to have a community board for wild swimmers to chat to each other and post stories and photos from their swims and connect together

- Date Picker:
Currently the date picker allows staff users to pick any date, a future implimentation would be to restrict the date picker to only have future dates

- Past Swims:
A section of the community page where past swims would automatically go after their date was passed so users could see what type of swims they had done previously

- Joined Swims saved to staff dashboard:
In the future I would like to have the join swim button log which user has joined which swim and have a staff dashboard area so that staff users could see how many people had signed up to that particular swim. 

- Join Swim button change to 'Swim Joined':
In the future I would like to add some jinja templating to change the 'Join Swim' button to say 'Swim Joined' - this was wanted for this version of the project however due to time constraints it was not able to be tested properly and applied.

- Message alerts:
Messages have been added into the views for both succesfful actions and unsuccessful actions, in the future I would like to use jinja templating to display these messages to the use rather than just redirecting them - this was wanted for this version of the project however due to time constraints it was not able to be tested properly and applied.
